# Black-Scholes-Merton formula

## What Is the Black Scholes Model?
The Black Scholes model, also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is a mathematical model for pricing an options contract. In particular, the model estimates the variation over time of financial instruments. It assumes these instruments (such as stocks or futures) will have a lognormal distribution of prices. Using this assumption and factoring in other important variables, the equation derives the price of a call option.

The standard BSM model is only used to price European options and does not take into account that U.S. options could be exercised before the expiration date.

### The Black-Scholes model makes certain assumptions:

1. The option is European and can only be exercised at expiration.

2. No dividends are paid out during the life of the option.

3. Markets are efficient (i.e., market movements cannot be predicted).

4. There are no transaction costs in buying the option.

5. The risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying are known and constant.

6. The returns on the underlying asset are normally distributed.
